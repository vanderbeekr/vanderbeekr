                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no current scientific consensus as to how life originated. However, most of all accepted scientific models build on the Miller–Urey experiment and the work of Sidney Fox, which show that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesize amino acids and other organic compounds from inorganic precursors, and phospholipids spontaneously form lipid bilayers, the basic structure of a cell membrane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some theater actors need to learn stage combat, which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand fighting or sword-fighting. Actors one type coached by fight directors, who help them learn the choreographed sequence of fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous generation was the belief that living organisms can form without descent from similar organisms. Typically, the idea was that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust or the supposed seasonal generation of mice and insects from mud or garbage. The theory of spontaneous generation was proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There’ll be no one to stop us!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to come with you to Alderaan. There’s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geological findings in 2013 showed that reactive phosphorus species (like phosphite) were in abundance in the ocean before 3.5 Ga, and that Schreibersite easily reacts with aqueous glycerol to generate phosphite and glycerol 3-phosphate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prebiotic compounds may have originated extraterrestrially. NASA findings in 2011, based on studies with meteorites found on Earth, suggest DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) may be formed in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems. It can also be termed as the zone of life on Earth, a closed system (apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the Earth), and largely self-regulating. By the most general biophysiological definition, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the and atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has the longest rail network in the world, nearly all standard gauge. The network handles mostly freight, with intercity passenger service provided by the government-subsidized Amtrak to all but four states. Transportation is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Wealth, like income and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food policy comprises the mechanisms by which food-related matters are addressed or administered by governments, including international bodies or networks, and by public institutions or private organizations. Agricultural producers often bear the burden of governments’ desire to keep food prices sufficiently low for growing urban populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geological findings in 2013 showed that reactive phosphorus species (like phosphite) were in abundance in the ocean before 3.5 Ga, and that Schreibersite easily reacts with aqueous glycerol to generate phosphite and glycerol 3-phosphate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prebiotic compounds may have originated extraterrestrially. NASA findings in 2011, based on studies with meteorites found on Earth, suggest DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) may be formed in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems.

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no current scientific consensus as to how life originated. However, most of all accepted scientific models build on the Miller–Urey experiment and the work of Sidney Fox, which show that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesize amino acids and other organic compounds from inorganic precursors, and phospholipids spontaneously form lipid bilayers, the basic structure of a cell membrane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some theater actors need to learn stage combat, which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand fighting or sword-fighting. Actors one type coached by fight directors, who help them learn the choreographed sequence of fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous generation was the belief that living organisms can form without descent from similar organisms. Typically, the idea was that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust or the supposed seasonal generation of mice and insects from mud or garbage. The theory of spontaneous generation was proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no current scientific consensus as to how life originated. However, most of all accepted scientific models build on the Miller–Urey experiment and the work of Sidney Fox, which show that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesize amino acids and other organic compounds from inorganic precursors, and phospholipids spontaneously form lipid bilayers, the basic structure of a cell membrane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some theater actors need to learn stage combat, which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand fighting or sword-fighting. Actors one type coached by fight directors, who help them learn the choreographed sequence of fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous generation was the belief that living organisms can form without descent from similar organisms. Typically, the idea was that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust or the supposed seasonal generation of mice and insects from mud or garbage. The theory of spontaneous generation was proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There’ll be no one to stop us!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to come with you to Alderaan. There’s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geological findings in 2013 showed that reactive phosphorus species (like phosphite) were in abundance in the ocean before 3.5 Ga, and that Schreibersite easily reacts with aqueous glycerol to generate phosphite and glycerol 3-phosphate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prebiotic compounds may have originated extraterrestrially. NASA findings in 2011, based on studies with meteorites found on Earth, suggest DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) may be formed in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The longer I live, the more I realize that I am never wrong about anything, and that all the pains I have so humbly taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems. It can also be termed as the zone of life on Earth, a closed system (apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the Earth), and largely self-regulating. By the most general biophysiological definition, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the and atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has the longest rail network in the world, nearly all standard gauge. The network handles mostly freight, with intercity passenger service provided by the government-subsidized Amtrak to all but four states. Transportation is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Wealth, like income and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food policy comprises the mechanisms by which food-related matters are addressed or administered by governments, including international bodies or networks, and by public institutions or private organizations. Agricultural producers often bear the burden of governments’ desire to keep food prices sufficiently low for growing urban populations.&lt;/p&gt;
